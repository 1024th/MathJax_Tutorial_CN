π,\pi,Pi pi;3.1415926...;≈355÷113 mathematical constant,"Used in various formulas involving circles; π is equivalent to the amount of area a circle would take up in a square of equal width with an area of 4 square units, roughly 3.14159. It is also the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle.",A = πR2 = 314.16 → R = 10
